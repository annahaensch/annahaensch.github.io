<h2>
Short Biography
</h2>

<p>
Anna holds a PhD in mathematics and is currently a senior data scientist at the Tufts Institute for Artificial Intelligence (formerly the Data Intensive Studies Center) at Tufts University with secondary faculty appointments in the Department of Mathematics and the Fletcher Graduate School for International Affairs.  Her research lies at the intersection of mathematics and the social sciences and it deals with the many ways that we can connect data-driven systems to policy to make a safer, more sustainable, and more equitable world.

<h2>
Medium Biography
</h2>
<p>
Anna holds a PhD in mathematics and is currently a senior data scientist at the Tufts Institute for Artificial Intelligence (formerly the Data Intensive Studies Center) at Tufts University with secondary faculty appointments in the Department of Mathematics and the Fletcher Graduate School for International Affairs.  Her research deals with applications of AI and statistical machine learning to problems at the intersection of technology and society.  She has led NSF-funded work alongside engineers in renewable energy, applying machine learning models to offshore wind farm safety and reliability. She is also director emeritus of the Data Science, Police Accountability, and Community Engagement research lab, where she worked alongside an interdisciplinary team to develop statistical tools and neural networks to make data on policing more accessible and useful. In 2013 she was awarded a AAAS Mass Media Fellowship which she spent working on the science desk at National Public Radio in Washington, D.C. In addition to her academic research, Anna is interested in the ways that numerical literacy shape democracy and how that is reflected in the media.  Prior to her present position, Anna also held a postdoctoral position at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Germany, and was a tenured faculty member in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Duquesne University.

<h2>
  Long Biography
</h2>

<p>  
  Anna is a senior data scientist in the <a 
  href=https://disc.tufts.edu/>Tufts Institute for Artificial Intelligence (formerly the Data Intensive Studies Center) at Tufts University</a> with a secondary appointment in the Department of 
  Mathematics and the Fletcher Graduate School for Global Affairs.  She earned her Ph.D. in mathematics from Wesleyan 
  University in 2013, after which she was a visiting scientist
  at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics.  The roots of her research are in <a href="file:///home/annahaensch/Dropbox/website/annahaensch/number_theory.html">computational number theory</a>, specifically in using modern computational tools and capabilities to answer longstanding, previously intractable, open problems.  
  Until 2021, she was on 
  the faculty of the <a href = 
  "https://www.duq.edu/academics/schools/liberal-arts/academics/departments-and-centers/mathematics-and-computer-science/undergraduate-programs/mathematics-ba/bs-">Duquesne University Department of Mathematics & Computer Science</a>, where she was granted tenure and promotion to associate professor in 2020. 
</p>

<p>
  On a brief leave from academia, she spent 15 months working as a 
  research data scientist at a start-up in the Boston area 
  called <a href="https://www.tagup.io/">Tagup</a>.  In this position, 
  her interest in algorithmic development led her to explore tools in 
  data science and machine learning.  Specifically, the ways we can use 
  these tools to make a safer and more equitable world, from 
  understanding and mitigating the impacts of climate change to 
  resource allocation on a local and global scale. In this position, 
  Anna began to consider the ways that machine learning can be applied 
  to the domain of offshore wind to optimize the life of wind turbines 
  and the safety of turbine operators.
</p>

<p>
Since joining Tufts she's developed several transdisciplinary 
collaborations.  She works closely with the Tufts Univeristy Art 
Gallery to apply the princples of data science to develop tools in 
improve equity in public art.  She continues her work on turbines with 
faculty in enginneering, policy, and public health, and is Co-PI on an NSF 
grant to develop <a href = 
"https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2230630&HistoricalAwards=false">policy-aware digital twins of offshore wind turbines</a>.  She also does work related to the connection between public opinion and public policy and is especially interested in policing. She is director emeritus of the Data Science, Police Accountability, and Community Engagement research lab
</p>
<p>
  In 2013 she was awarded the AAAS-AMS Mass Media Fellowship during 
  which she spent 10 weeks working on the Science Desk at National 
  Public Radio.  In addition to the technical applications of data 
  science, she's interested in the ways that data and numerical 
  literacy more generally shape the way we produce and consume <a 
  href="media.html">media</a>. Consequently, she is committed to practicing data science in a way that connects the technical to the social.
</p>  
<p>
  In her free time she likes to make <a href="illustrations.html">art</a>.

<h2>
  How to Pronounce My Name
</h2>
<p>
Since it's caused confusion in the past, I should say that my name, 
Anna Haensch, rhymes with "sauna bench."  At the risk of causing confusion in the future too, I'll add that it's German in origin -- just like me! -- and my surname can also be spelled H&#228;nsch.
