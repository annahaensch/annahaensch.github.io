He was kind enough to share the materials with me, and similarly, I am happy to share these materials with you. The textbook is Ted Sundstrom's <b><a href="https://www.tedsundstrom.com/mathematical-reasoning-writing-and-proof">Mathematical Reasoning: Writing and Proof</a></b>.  I taught this course most recently in Spring 2019 at Duquesne University.</i>

Welcome to the math 250 course page!  This website will be a resource for you as we move through the course.  I'll be using it as a place to post important course updates and materials, as well as a place to remind you about due dates.  Check back often!  
      </p>  

<p>
I'll say more about the proof portfolio as we move through the semester, but sometime before Thursday 01.17, go to <a href=http://www.overleaf.com>overleaf.com</a> and set up an account.  We'll take some time in class on 01.17 to work through the basics of LaTeX (pronounced like "Lah-Tech," not like the stuff doctor gloves are made out of).

<p>
Please remember to do your daily prep (below) for Thursday January 17th, and be sure to look over the Daily Prep Guidelines (above) to make sure will receive full credit for your daily prep. On Thursday we will finish section 1.2 and begin sections 2.1 and 2.2.  At the end of class we will take some time to set up overleaf.  You may want to bring your laptop to class for this part.

Here is <a href=foundations_of_mathematics/GroupA_250.pdf>Problem Group A</a>.  You are responsible for submitting one draft of one problem from group A on Thursday 01.24.19, following the guidelines in the <a href=foundations_of_mathematics/PPGuidelines_S19.pdf>Proof Portfolio Guidelines</a>.  Next week we will finish Section 2.2 and move into Chapter 3.

On Thursday you will be responsible for submitting one draft of one proof from <a href=foundations_of_mathematics/GroupA_250.pdf>Problem Group A</a>.  If you have questions about this, please come and see me in my office hours or send me an email. Note, this Wednesday my afternoon office hours will be 1-2 and 3-4 (I have a meeting from 2-3).

I've reviewed all of your proof portfolio submissions and left comments (they are written in blue) on your projects.  If you have any questions please email me or come and see me. Your next draft is due on Tuesday 01.29.19.

<p>
Because of the missed class this week, I've asked you to finish the activity sheet for section 3.2 on your own.  If you have any questions about that, you can ask them at the beginning of class on Tuesday 2.5.19.  Proof portfolio due dates will carry on as usual, they are not affected by the class cancelation. 
</p>

<p>
We will have our fist exam on Thursday 2.14.19, it will cover all of the sections we've covered in class (you can check the <a href=foundations_of_mathematics/CourseOutline_250_S19.pdf>course outline</a> above to see exactly what we've covered).  The questions will come directly from the Sundstrom text.

Today we finished Section 3.3 and on Thursday this week we will do section 3.4.  Our first exam will be on Thursday 02.14.19, so you should definitely start working on problems in preparation for the exam. 
</p>

<p>
A note on proof portfolios, since there still seems to be some confusion.  Each week you will submit two proofs, one on Tuesday and one on Thursday.  Each of these proofs will be done on Overleaf with the project title

Our first exam will be on Thursday 02.14, it will cover all of the sections we've covered up through section 3.5. There will be no proof portfolio draft due on the day of the exam.  My office hours are on Wednesdays 10-12 and 1-3, many of you are already in the habit of coming to see me, which is great.  Come and see me if you have questions or if I can clarify anything in your proof portfolio (I know that sometimes the comments can be a little bit difficult to parse).

Just a reminder that my office hours this week are a bit different since I have a meeting on Wednesday afternoon.  So this week my office hours on Wednesday 02.13 are 10-12, 1-2 and 3-4. There will be no proof portfolio due on Thursday this week.

Your exams are graded and you may come and pick them up during my office hours or at another time on Thursday (although you may want to email me first to make sure I'm here).  Unfortunately this week I have a meeting on Wednesday, so I'll have my office hours on Wednesday 10-12 and 1-2 and 3-4 (note the time change).

There will be two proof portfolio drafts due this week as usual, and our next exam will be on Thursday March 21st.

Wonderful job on your proofs by induction today!  Just a reminder that your tenth proof submission is due on Thursday this week, and then there will be no drafts due until after spring break.  That means that after this week you should be halfway finished with your proof portfolio. This would be a good time to look through your drafts and see if there are any parts that I can help you perfect during my office hours.

Our next exam will be two weeks after break, on Thursday 03.21.19, again the exam will cover all of the sections we've covered up until that day (see the <a href=foundations_of_mathematics/CourseOutline_250_S19.pdf>course outline</a> for section numbers) and the proofs will come from the Sundstrom text. There will be no proof portfolio drafts due over break, so your next draft will be submitted on Tuesday 03.12.19.  Have a wonderful/restful/restorative/fun break!

I just want to remind everyone that the proof portfolio is due on the last day of class, at the beginning of class.  You should be prepared to hand me, printed out and stapled, copies of 10 different proofs.  Per the <a href=foundations_of_mathematics/PPGuidelines_S19.pdf>Proof Portfolio Guidelines</a>, the last day to submit proofs for grading is today Thursday 04.11, but since I've been out of town I'll extend that deadline to <b>Tuesday 04.16</b>.  At this point you have had 20 draft due, and you should be putting the finishing touches on your final drafts.

If you've been keeping up with your drafts and due dates (great job!) you should have finished two drafts of all 10 proofs at this point.
